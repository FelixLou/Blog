# Blog
Please visit my blog on: https://stark-citadel-2366.herokuapp.com. You need to signup first, then you could see other users, follow them, see their posts, post your own posts and so on. The relationship between users is like Twitter, you could choose who to follow and unfollow. I have pre-create some users and microposts using seed to have a nice look.

I was following the Ruby on Rail Tutorial(https://www.railstutorial.org/book) to design this website, many ideas were inspired by it. However, I found a few bugs and revised it by myself. Also, I skiped some functions due to my limited time. I might add functions and revise it when I am free.

Hope you enjoy my website!
